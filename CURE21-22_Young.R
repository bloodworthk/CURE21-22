#### Update ggplot2 theme ####
#Update ggplot2 theme - make box around the x-axis title size 30, vertically justify x-axis title to 0.35, 
#Place a margin of 15 around the x-axis title.  
#Make the x-axis title size 30. For y-axis title, make the box size 30, put the writing at a 90 degree angle, and vertically justify the title to 0.5.  
#Add a margin of 15 and make the y-axis text size 25. Make the plot title size 30 and vertically justify it to 2.  Do not add any grid lines.  
#Do not add a legend title, and make the legend size 20
